                        <p class="Cont">The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated
                            junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and
                            the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
                            Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may
                            be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
                            adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
                            called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
                            (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they
                            were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some
                            places. The chicken domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its
                            eggs are Layers. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread
                            domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2]
                            up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the
                            world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to
                            chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
                            literature.<br> Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin
                            theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the
                            clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa
                            originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken

                            annals of Thutmose III. They are known in Greece from the 5th century
