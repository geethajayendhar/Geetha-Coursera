                        <p class="Cont">Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack
                            limbs with digits. Included in this definition are the living hagfish,
                            lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct
                            related groups. Approximately 95% of living fish species are ray-finned
                            fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with around 99% of those
                            being teleosts. The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish
                            were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian
                            period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords
                            which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate
                            counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era,
                            diversifying into a wide variety of forms.<br> Many fish of the Paleozoic
                            developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first
                            fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such
                            as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey
                            of arthropods. Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing
                            their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though
                            some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a
                            higher core temperature.[1][2] Fish can acoustically communicate with
                            each other, most often in the context of feeding, aggression or
                            courtship.[3] Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be
                            found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams
                            (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the
                            deepest oceans (e.g., cusk-eels and snailfish), although no species has
                            yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean.[4] With 34,300
                            described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other
                            group of vertebrates.[5] Fish are an important resource for humans
                            worldwide, especially as food.<br> Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt
                            fish in wild fisheries or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean
                            (in aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as
                            pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have
                            had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious
                            symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies. Tetrapods
                            (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) emerged within lobe-finned
                            fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally
                            fish (pisces or ichthyes) are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the
                            tetrapods, and are therefore not considered a formal taxonomic grouping
                            in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense,
                            including tetrapods,[6][7] although usually "vertebrate" is preferred
                            and used for this purpose (fish plus tetrapods) instead. Furthermore,
                            cetaceans, although mammals, have often been considered fish by various
                            cultures and time periods.</p>
